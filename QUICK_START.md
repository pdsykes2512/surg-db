## Known Limitations

These are tracked in TODO.md for future development.

## Troubleshooting

- Check required fields (marked with *)
- Ensure Patient ID exists in the system
- Check browser console for errors

**Reports showing "No Data"?**
- Create at least one episode first

- Verify backend is running

**Filters not working?**
- Clear all filters and try again
- Check date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
